            <span>You Are Special <br>
            I want you to be with me forever, doesn't matter how we met or how late we met it's just that some people are so close to us that all we pray is "I need that person to be with me forever" | do the same when think about you because it's a beautiful feeling when have someone like you who actually knows me better it's actually hard to think a day without you. 
                You were a stranger to me, now you are my favourite person, a person closest to my heart, a person whom I actually love to talk to whole day, you have always made me feel special in everyway, from those little fights, those little conversations to having those laughs and memories we can never forget. You have become so important to me, that whenever I try to explain you fail, I cry, I smile, I irritate you, I get angry, I'm worse, its all with you because I know you won't be the person who will leave me for such reasons, you know me well. You know how I always run up to you when I need someone. I always feel better when you say "I'm there for you" I have thoughts about what would happen if you ever get tired of me & leave me, please don't, I'm Sorry can't see you getting close to someone else, I'm possesive & that's the reason sometimes get angry because I am afraid to lose you, you're the only one person have, with whom feel comfortable, you're beautiful and most important to me. 
                Please be with me forever.I love you so much....
            I just want to take you in my arms and then cry a lot, kiss you a lot, love you a lot.. I want you,
          I want you so badly and Only you..You're the only person who has ever made me feel like this and it's only you who can..
          I want to spend every day with you.. I want you to hug me so tightly that I can't breathe..
I want to see you smile.. I want to see you and honor you at your highest and I want to help you at your lowest. I want to be the reason you smile.
          I want you to think about me every second just like I think about you..
I want you to hold me and tell me that everything is gonna be okay..I don't want you to be scared to show me The Real You. I want to wipe all your tears and give you the biggest hugs..
I want us to watch the sunrise and sunsets together. I want to stay up all night laughing with you. I want to be with you so so badly and I want you to feel the same. 
          But most importantly I want you to love me like no one else in the world matters. I just want you to Love Me..</span>
