            <h2>You Are Special <br>
            I want you to be with me forever, doesn't matter how we met or how late we met it's just that some people are so close to us that all we pray is "I need that person to be with me forever" | do the same when think about you because it's a beautiful feeling when have someone like you who actually knows me better it's actually hard to think a day without you. You were a stranger to me, now you are my favourite person, a person closest to my heart, a person whom I actually love to talk to whole day, you have always made me feel special in everyway, from those little fights, those little conversations to having those laughs and memories we can never forget. You have become so important to me, that whenever I try to explain you fail, I cry, I smile, I irritate you, I get angry, I'm worse, its all with you because I know you won't be the person who will leave me for such reasons, you know me well. You know how I always run up to you when I need someone. I always feel better when you say "I'm there for you" I have thoughts about what would happen if you ever get tired of me & leave me, please don't, I'm Sorry can't see you getting close to someone else, I'm possesive & that's the reason sometimes get angry because I am afraid to lose you, you're the only one person have, with whom feel comfortable, you're beautiful and most important to me. Please be with me forever. I love you so much.....<3</h2>
